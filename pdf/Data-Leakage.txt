Appendix A - Specific Use Case
Lost or Stolen Device
There is little an organisation can do to recover a device that is no longer in the physical control of the organisation. Lost devices may be easily found using location tracking technology and then recovered, however recovery is less likely in the case of stolen devices. The loss or theft should be reported to the local police - they will have a higher chance of recovering and returning a stolen device.

Special Considerations
	1. If they are not already aware, report lost devices to the Service Desk.
	2. Ensure device is reported to the authorities - if the device is recovered it may be returned.
	3. If the device is running software that allows for location tracking, ensure that this is activated and information is passed to 	the relevant teams.
	4. Monitor for attempted connections back to the organisation through compromised accounts.
	5. Ensure that remote wiping software has been activated to remove any potentially sensitive data. Be aware that this will also 	prevent any future location tracking attempts.
	6. Determine the details of what state the device was in when it was lost or stolen:
		• Was the device switched on or fully powered off (not in sleep/standby)?
		• Does the device utilise some form of encryption?
		• Was the device locked or unlocked?
	7. Ensure that all passwords associated with the device and users of the device have been changed.
	8. Determine the sensitivity of any information held on the device and increase awareness over potential incidents that may be 	caused as a result.

Physical Data Leakage

Data being leaked or exfiltrated physically is one of the primary methods that an insider will use to remove data from the organisation. Storage devices are getting increasingly smaller and can hold more data. These can easily be concealed when leaving an organisation and then accessed from another location. Personal devices such as mobile phones can also be used to exfiltrate data.
Special Considerations
	1. Monitor controls that are in place that can detect transfer of data to removable media.
	2. Identify where the user is that is exfiltrating data and remove any access as appropriate.
	3. When the employee is located ensure that all removable media devices are seized - consult legal/HR throughout this process as 	personal devices may be involved that are outside the remit
	4. Ensure that the chain of custody is maintained throughout the seizure process.

Third Party Data Leak
A third-party data leak occurs when a third party that is handling data experiences a breach and as a result, becomes compromised. Other than contractual requirements, there is little influence that have over data is secured by the third party.

Special Considerations
	1. Ensure that good communication is maintained between and third parties, such as the correct communication channels during 	incidents. If there are any breaches that could affec notice should be provided as soon as possible however this is dependent on 	the third party notifying KTB. 
	2. Communications from third parties about suspected data breaches may come via unexpected
	routes such as Telegram, etc.
	3. Advise third parties on appropriate security handling of data.
	4. Conduct reviews or audits of third parties to ensure that they are handling and protecting data in a secure manner.
	5. Work with the third party during a data breach - it is possible that they may be able to provide detail about the data that was 	at risk, allowing to take appropriate action.
	6. Ensure that the appropriate containment steps on systems are taken as appropriate, such as password resets. 
	7. Third Party Intelligence sources are aware of critical supplier relationships however discuss with them the current situation to 	establish whether the third party in question are being monitored. Generate a watch list if this is not the case.

Sensitive Data in Inappropriate Locations
There are occasions when data may be leaked through non-malicious means. Data could be uploaded to cloud services by mistake or saved to inappropriate locations within the enterprise that may have weaker security controls. Although not malicious in nature, these incidents can put data at risk and highlight a failure in current processes to mitigate such actions.
Special Considerations
	1. Review the location to identify access that is afforded by the current security controls.
	2. Review access and who could access the inappropriately placed data.
	3. Review access/ audit logs to identify any users that may have interacted with the data.
	4. Consider the placement of the data as potentially malicious. Data may be being aggregated to compress and extract from the 	organisation.
	5. Does the new location of the data have any High Availability / Back Up systems that may have duplicated the data? If so, ensure 	these areas have the data removed.
	6. Be aware that data may be moved to areas of "Shadow IT", systems that are not managed or maintained by administrators. This may 	introduce considerably larger concerns and risks.

Appendix B - IOC List, Typical Forensic Artefacts and Contextual Information Requirements
Indicators of Compromise
Indicators convey specific Observable patterns combined with contextual information intended to represent artefacts and/or behaviours of interest within a cyber-security context. They consist of one or more Observable patterns potentially mapped to a related Tactic, Technique or Procedure (TTP).
The following is a non-exhaustive list of Indicators of Compromise (IOC's) to be leveraged during Incident Response (IR) investigations:
	•IP Addresses
	•File Hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256 etc.)
	•URL's
	•URI's
	•Domain Name
	•Domain Registrant Information
	•Virus Signatures
	•File Name
	•Autonomous System Number (ASN)
	•User Defined Input (usernames, passwords etc.)
	•User Agents (UA's)
	•Unique / Identifiable Strings
	•Network Traffic patterns
	•Any item of intelligence that can directly indicate suspicious activity

Typical Forensic Artefacts
The following list details typical forensic artefacts that may be of interest during an investigation:
	•Operating System Logs (Windows Event Logs, syslog, etc.)
	•Application Specific Logs
	•Application Configuration Files
	•Operating System configuration files
	•Windows Registry Files
	•Deleted Files / Recycle Bin Contents

	•User Specific folder files
	•Internet History Databases
	•Email storage files (ost, mbox etc.)
	•Application Data folder
	•Temporary folders
	•Hibernation files
	•Page files
	•Crash Dumps
	•Server Management Logs
	•Networking Details

Contextual Information Requirements
During any incident analysts should aim to identify the following background information. This will assist with ongoing investigation, analysis, time lining, containment and remediation:
	•Dates and Times of reported suspicious activity
	•Affected persons views on the suspicious behaviour
	•Actions taken immediately prior to the initial incident Actions taken immediately after the initial incident
	•Affected systems roles
	•Critical business data stored on or associated with affected systems
	•Normal working behaviour of affected systems
	•Normal working behaviour or affected business unit and personnel
	•Other recent incidents affecting the same or similar systems
	•Historical incidents similar to ongoing issue
	•Time sensitivity / downtime issues likely to impact decision making
