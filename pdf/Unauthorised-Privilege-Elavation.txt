Appendix A - Specific Use Case
Physical Unauthorized Elevation of Privilege
Due to the nature of the events that deals with, there may be scenarios where sensitive assets must be left in public places where there is a chance of physical Unauthorized Elevation of Privilege. Depending on the segregation that is present in the network, this may allow unsuspected employees to bypass the main defences on the perimeter of the network and provide access to sensitive resources within the network.


Special Considerations
1. Ensure that sensitive equipment is protected adequately. The criticality of the asset should match the level of protection given. Protection mechanisms may include things such as padlocks, fenced off areas, and security guards. Assets should also be monitored using CCTV to assist with investigation.
2. Ensure that there is a well-defined list of what each asset is responsible for. This will ensure that if an asset is compromised, there is an understanding of where an attacker could reach and the impact that they may have.
3. If possible, segregate any publicly accessible assets to a secure part of the network with increased monitoring.
4. If an asset is deemed to be compromised, physical teams should move to secure the asset and assess the asset for signs of any physical tampering.
5. If the attacker has not been caught, protection over other physical assets in the area should be increased.
6. Outgoing connections from the compromised asset should be monitored and contained until the asset can be restored to a "known good" state.
7. Once the above steps have been considered, the main flow should be followed, and appropriate steps taken.

Appendix B - IOC List, Typical Forensic Artefacts and Contextual Information Requirements
Indicators of Compromise
Indicators convey specific observable patterns combined with contextual information intended to represent artefacts and/or behaviours of interest within a cyber-security context. They consist of one or more observable patterns potentially mapped to a related Tactic, Technique or Procedure (TTP).

The following is a non-exhaustive list of Indicators of Compromise (IOC's) to be leveraged during Incident Response (IR) investigations:

	•IP Addresses
	•File Hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256 etc.)
	•URLs 
	•URIS
	•Domain Name
	•Domain Registrant Information
	•Virus Signatures
	•File Name
	•Autonomous System Number (ASN)
	•User Defined Input (usernames, passwords etc.)
	•User Agents (UAS)
	•Unique / Identifiable Strings
	•Network Traffic patterns
	•Any item of intelligence that can directly indicate suspicious activity

Typical Forensic Artefacts
The following list details typical forensic artefacts that may be of interest during an investigation:

	•Operating System Logs (Windows Event Logs, syslog, etc.)
	•Application Specific Logs
	•Application Configuration Files
	•Operating System configuration files
	•Windows Registry Files
	•Deleted Files / Recycle Bin Contents
	•User Specific folder files
	•Internet History Databases
	•Email storage files (ost, mbox etc.)
	•Application Data folder
	•Temporary folders
	•Hibernation files
	•Page files
	•Crash Dumps
	•Server Management Logs
	•Networking Details


Contextual Information Requirements
During any incident, analysts should aim to identify the following background information. This will assist with ongoing investigation, analysis, time lining, containment and remediation:
	•Dates and Times of reported suspicious activity 
	•Affected persons views on the suspicious behaviour 
	•Actions taken immediately prior to the initial incident Actions taken immediately after the initial incident
	•Affected systems roles
	•Critical business data stored on or associated with affected systems
	•Normal working behaviour of affected systems
	•Normal working behaviour or affected business unit and personnel Other recent incidents affecting the same or similar systems
	•Historical incidents similar to ongoing issue
	•Time sensitivity / downtime issues likely to impact decision making
